              I&apos;m Andr√©s. A 22-year old software developer, maker and problem
              solver.
            </p>

            <p>
              Technology has always fascinated me, and I&apos;ve never been afraid to
              jump in and give it a go. In fact, I wrote my first line of code
              in the web browser of a Nintendo DSi, back when I was 11 years
              old.
            </p>

            <p>
              This adventurous, self-taught spirit has shaped most of the
              decisions of my life.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nowadays, I use the energy that led me to open that DSi browser to
              build cool stuff, and most importantly: build it fast.
