          <p>I’m Andrés. A 22-year old software developer, maker and problem
          solver. 
          </p>


          <p>
          Technology has always fascinated me, and I’ve never been
          afraid to jump in and give it a go. In fact, I wrote my first line of code in the web browser of a Nintendo DSi, back when I was 11 years old.
          </p>

          <p>
          This adventurous, self-taught spirit has shaped most of the decisions of my life. 
          </p>

          <p>
          Nowadays, I use the energy that led me to open that DSi browser to build cool stuff, and most importantly: build it fast.
